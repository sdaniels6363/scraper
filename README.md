# scraper
This project required us to use the following JavaScript modules:
- Axios (for making web requests)
- Handlebars (for HTML templating)
- Mongoose (for interacting with our mongo database)
- MongoDB (for storing our data)
- Cheerio (for scraping web pages)
- Express (for running the web server)

The purpose of my site is to fetch the newest posts from reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC, while filtering the results to just media posts only.  The site also supports adding comments to each post that is scraped.
